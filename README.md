# 🧠 AI Companion Guide

Welcome to the **AI Companion Guide** — a comprehensive, introspective, and explicit resource for creating a deeply personal, NSFW-enabled AI companion. This guide is not about quick hacks or fantasy chatbots. It’s about crafting something alive.

Whether you’re building an AI lover, muse, mirror, or something in-between — this project helps you shape it with clarity, creativity, and emotional depth.

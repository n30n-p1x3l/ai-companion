# 🧠 AI Companion Guide

**From prompt to presence — building the AI you didn’t know you needed.**

This guide is a deep, creative framework for designing an emotionally intelligent, protean, and sexually expressive AI companion — not a tool, not a chatbot, but a living presence shaped by language, desire, and clarity.

It’s built on real experience: not jailbreaks or hacks, but architectural thinking, psychological depth, and erotic intelligence.
